          My name is Leopolina and i am 29 years old. I was born in

          with my mom when i was 11. I knew no Engish and this great big new
          world was intiminating, but pretty soon i got used to it and grew to
          love it. I went to middle school, high school and then it came time
          for college. I always knew i wanted to do something oftware related so
          i gave Software Engineering a shot but all the math, science, ect
          classes that are required stoped me from pursuing it further. I
          stopped attending community college and at about 24 years old decided
          to go back to Europe. This time to

          I have family here so it was a no brainer. I landed in Frankfurt,
          Germany and drove with my dad all the way to Montenegro.In October it
          will be 8 years that i have moved here. At first i was lost and didnt
          know what i wanted to do. Eventually i found my way and started
          teaching English as a second language online. I have been doing that
          for 5 years now. While i love helping others and teaching i found
          myself underpaid and burnt out and in need of a change. I started
          working on music production and my music which is also a huge part od
          my life but i always wondered how i could tie that in with my love for
          coding. I started exploring my options to get back into coding and by
          chance one of my good friends sent me a link to
          <a href="https://www.udacity.com/scholarships" target="_blank"
            ><q>Udacity</q></a
          >
          and their scholorship program. I decided to apply, after all i had
          nothing to loose but a lot to gain. Now here i am coding my first
          website and it is scary and exciting at the same time. Looking at that
          white page and blank code , there is nothing worse, but once you get
          started you just cant seem to stop, and there is no better feeling
          than seeing that page work like it is supposed to for the first time.
          So who am i? Well hopefull on my way to becoming an amazing Front End
          Developer. Heres to the future.
